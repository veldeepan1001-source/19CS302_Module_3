# EX 12 C program to check whether the given number is prime or not using function without return type and with arguments.
## AIM:
To write a C program to check whether the given number is prime or not using function without return type and with arguments.

## Algorithm
1. Start 
2. Declare the variable i. 
3. Read the value given using scanf. 
4. Check whether the given number is prime or not using if-else statement condition. 
5. If true,print ("%d is a prime number.",i). 
6. If false, print ("%d is not a prime number.",i). 
7. End.
   
## Program:
```
#include<stdio.h> 
int main() 
{ 
int i; 
scanf("%d",&i); 
if(i%2==1 && i%1==0) 
{ 
printf("%d is a prime number.",i); 
 
} 
else 
{ 
printf("%d is not a prime number.",i); 
} 
return 0; 
} 
```

## Output:
